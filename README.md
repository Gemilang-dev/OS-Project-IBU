## Overview of the Shell System

---

### üîÅ Shell Main Loop

- **Function**: The shell continuously runs as long as its process is active. It accepts user input, executes commands, and returns to the prompt for the next command.
- **Process**:
  1. Execution starts in the `main()` function (in `shell.c`).
  2. `display_prompt()` shows the prompt with username, machine name, and directory path.
  3. `fgets()` reads the command from user input.

---

### üí¨ Prompt

- **Prompt Formats**:
  - **Advanced Prompt**: `machinename@username:~$` ‚Äî shows username, machine name, and relative path if in the home directory.
  - **Basic Prompt**: `prompt$` ‚Äî shows either the relative or full path.
- You can toggle between prompt formats using the `switch` command.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Handling Commands

- **`handle_command()`**:
  - Validates and handles user-entered commands.
  - Implements built-in shell commands like `cd`, `exit`, `history`, `fortune`, `checkGuardian`, `cp`, etc.

- **Command Functions**:
  - `cd`, `exit`, and `history` are processed directly.
  - `fortune`, `checkGuardian`, and `cp` are executed using `fork()` and `execvp()`.

---

### üì§ Output Redirection & üîó Piping

- **Redirection (`>`):**
  - Redirects command output to a file.
  - Handled by `execute_redirect()`, using `open()` and `dup2()`.

- **Piping (`|`):**
  - Passes the output of one command as input to another.
  - Handled by `execute_pipe()`, which creates two child processes with `fork()`.

---

### üöÄ Execution Functions

- **`execvp()`**: Runs commands in a child process, searching the command in system `PATH`.
- **`fork()`**: Creates child processes; parent waits with `wait()`.

---

### ‚ú® Other Features

- **`slist`**: Generates a file `slist.txt` containing multiplication results from 1√ó1 to 100√ó100.
- **`checkGuardian`**: Randomly displays one of 10 predefined guardian names.
- **`forkbomb`**: Continuously spawns processes using `fork()` to overload system resources (for educational/demonstration purposes only ‚ö†Ô∏è).

---

### üß≠ Shell Project Workflow Diagram

1. **Shell Start**
   - Program begins with `main()`
   - Prompt is displayed via `display_prompt()`

2. **User Inputs Command**
   - User types a command and presses Enter
   - Command is read using `fgets()` and passed to `handle_command()`

3. **Command Validation**
   - Checks if command is built-in (`cd`, `history`, etc.)
   - If so, appropriate function is called

4. **Executing Other Commands**
   - For non-built-in commands, `fork()` and `execvp()` are used

5. **Handling Redirection & Piping**
   - If `>` or `|` is found:
     - `execute_redirect()` handles redirection
     - `execute_pipe()` handles piping

6. **Command Execution**
   - In child process, command is executed via `execvp()` or `execlp()`
   - Output is displayed if successful

7. **Parent Process**
   - Waits for child to finish using `wait()`

8. **Repeat**
   - Shell goes back to displaying prompt, ready for the next command

## Task 1.1: Shell Interface üñ•Ô∏è
=============================

### Objective: üéØ
--------------
The goal of **Task 1.1** is to create a basic shell interface that:

- Continuously prompts the user for input. ‚å®Ô∏è
- Executes commands based on the user‚Äôs input. ‚öôÔ∏è
- Returns to the prompt to ask for new input. üîÑ

The shell should display a prompt indicating readiness to receive commands. Initially, the prompt shows in a **Basic format** (`prompt$`), and later it is updated to an **Advanced format** (`machinename@username:~$`).

---

### Basic Prompt vs Advanced Prompt üíª
-----------------------------------

- **Basic Prompt**: Displays only `prompt$` when waiting for user input. üìú
  
- **Advanced Prompt**: Displays `machinename@username:~$`, where:
  - `machinename`: Represents the name of the system. üñ•Ô∏è
  - `username`: Represents the active user‚Äôs name. üßë‚Äçüíª

---

### Functionality: ‚ö°
-------------------
- The shell is designed to display a prompt and accept commands from the user. ‚è≥
  
- Users can switch between the **Basic Prompt** (`prompt$`) and **Advanced Prompt** (`machinename@username:~$`) by typing the command **`switch`**. üîÄ

---

## How to Run the Shell

### Step 1: Compile the Program

To compile the shell, navigate to the project directory **`FirstProject/`** and run the following command:

```bash
make
```
This will compile the program and create the binary executable ./bin/shell.

Step 2: Run the Shell
Once compiled, you can run the shell with the following command:

```bash
./bin/shell
```
This will start the shell with the Advanced Prompt format by default.

## Switching Between Basic and Advanced Prompts

### Changing from Basic to Advanced Prompt and Vice Versa

- **Default Format**: When the shell starts, it displays the prompt in **Advanced format** by default. The prompt will look like:
```bash
machinename@username:~$
```
- **Switching to Basic Format**: To switch from **Advanced Prompt** to **Basic Prompt**, type the command:
```bash
switch
```
- **Switching Back to Advanced Format**: If you are currently in the **Basic Prompt**, you can switch back to the **Advanced Prompt** by typing the command:
```bash
prompt$
```

## List of Commands that can be Executed

Here is a list of basic commands that can be executed in the shell after implementing **Task 1.1**:

1. **`ls`**  
   - Lists the files and directories in the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```

2. **`exit`**  
   - Exits the shell program and returns to the terminal.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     exit
     ```

3. **`pwd`**  
   - Displays the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pwd
     ```

4. **`cd`**  
   - Changes the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/directory
     ```

5. **`echo`**  
   - Prints the provided string to the console.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     echo "Hello, World!"
     ```

6. **`switch`**  
   - Switches between **Basic Prompt** and **Advanced Prompt**.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     switch
     ```
## Task 1.2: Shell Commands

### Objective:
The goal of **Task 2.2** is to implement several useful shell commands and integrate them into the previously created shell. These commands allow users to perform file management tasks, view system information, and interact with the shell more effectively. Below are the functions that have been implemented as part of this task.

### List of Commands Implemented:

1. **`history`**  
   - Displays the history of commands that have been previously executed by the user.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     history
     ```

2. **`free`**  
   - Displays system memory usage, including used, free, and swap memory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     free
     ```

3. **`fortune`**  
   - Displays a random quote. Several predefined quotes are shown randomly when this command is executed.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     fortune
     ```

4. **`touch <filename>`**  
   - Creates a new file with the specified name. If the file already exists, this command will not modify it.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     touch newfile.txt
     ```

5. **`cp <source> <destination>`**  
   - Copies a file or directory from the source to the destination.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cp testfile.txt copyfile.txt
     ```

6. **`slist`**  
   - Creates a file named `slist.txt` containing the multiplication table from 1x1=1 to 100x100=10000.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     slist
     ```

7. **`checkGuardian`**  
   - Displays a random guardian from a predefined list. The guardians are fictional characters with humorous descriptions.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     checkGuardian
     ```

## Task 1.3: System Calls Implementation
IT 204 Operating Systems
Shell Project - March 2025

### Overview:
In this task, we explore system calls in C programming. The system calls implemented are:

- fork()
- wait()
- exec()
- execlp()
- rfork()
- forkbomb (exploration)

These system calls are used in the context of a shell program to create processes, wait for processes to finish, and execute new programs.

### Implementation:
Below is the terminal output with embedded comments explaining each command and its corresponding system call:

#### Terminal Output 1:
```bash

```

#### Explanation:
This is the initial output of running the shell. It displays the contents of the directory after performing a fork() call, where the child process is created.
The parent process waits for the child to finish, as indicated by the message "This is the parent process, waiting for the child to finish."
The child process also outputs the message "This is the child process." This confirms the successful creation of a child process using fork().

#### Terminal Output 2:
```bash

#### Explanation:
This output shows the result of calling the fork_test program. The parent process waits for the child to finish (as shown by the "waiting for the child to finish" message).
After the child finishes its task, it prints the "Child process finished." message.

#### Terminal Output 3:
```bash
ayi_qli_emilang@INBOOKX2GEN11:~/OS-IBU/OS-Project-IBU/First Project$ echo "Hello, World!"

#### Explanation:
This output shows the usage of the echo command within a process. The parent waits for the child process to finish.
The child process prints "Hello, World!" to indicate successful execution. This demonstrates how exec() could replace the current process image with a new program.

#### Terminal Output 4:

## üåà Task 1.4: Add Some Colors to Your Shell and Give It a Name! üêö

### üìã Task Description

In this task, you're asked to create a **custom shell prompt** that's not only functional but also **colorful and full of personality**!  
Using **ANSI escape sequences**, we can add color to terminal text to make it more visually appealing and easier to read.

### üé® Colors Used

| Color       | Purpose                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| üü¢ Green     | For the username and hostname (advanced prompt)      |
| üîµ Blue      | For username and hostname when outside the `home` directory |
| üü° Yellow    | For displaying the current path (basic prompt)       |
| ‚¨ú Reset     | To reset the terminal color to default after prompt  |

## üß† How the Prompt Works

The `display_prompt()` function shows the prompt in **two different styles** based on the `use_advanced_prompt` flag:

### üß™ 1. Advanced Prompt

Format:  
```bash
username@hostname:~/subdir$
```

### üß™ 2. Basic Prompt Format

Format:
    prompt$ ~/subdir$

Explanation:
- Displays the shell name (prompt) and the current working directory.
- The directory path is shown in üü° YELLOW.

### üìÅ Directory Display:

- If the current directory is inside the user's home directory, it is shown as `~`.
- Username and hostname are color-coded:
  - üü¢ GREEN if inside the home directory.
  - üîµ BLUE if outside the home directory.

### üõ†Ô∏è ANSI Color Definitions (in C)

Use the following color definitions in your C program:

    #define RESET_COLOR "\033[0m"
    #define GREEN       "\033[32m"
    #define BLUE        "\033[34m"
    #define YELLOW      "\033[33m"

### üìå Extra Notes

With these color enhancements, this shell prompt becomes:
‚úÖ Easier to read  
‚úÖ Easier to navigate  
‚úÖ Uniquely   

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

To display your stylish new shell prompt, call the `display_prompt()` function inside the `main()` function like this:

```c
int main() {
    // Show the colorful prompt
    display_prompt();

    // Shell operations go here...
    return 0;
}
```

## üìò Operating Systems Questions 1.5



### üîπ Question 1.5.1: Kernel vs User Mode


üß™ Scenario: Program tries to read data from disk  
üîß Kernel Mode Required

‚û°Ô∏è Why?  
Reading from a disk requires system-level privileges, which are only granted in kernel mode.  
User mode programs cannot directly perform I/O operations and must make system calls to the kernel.

üïí Scenario: Program reads the current time from the hardware clock  
üîß Kernel Mode Required

‚û°Ô∏è Why?  
Accessing the hardware clock requires privileged instructions. These are restricted to kernel mode to ensure security and system stability.


### üîπ Question 1.5.2: System Calls


System calls provide a controlled interface for user applications to request services from the operating system.  
Applications can't directly access hardware or sensitive system resources ‚Äî instead, they rely on system calls.

üß∞ **Common Types of System Calls & Examples:**

1. **üîÑ Process Control**
   - `fork()`  ‚Üí Creates a new process.
   - `exit()`  ‚Üí Terminates the current process.

2. **üìÇ File Management**
   - `open()`  ‚Üí Opens a file.
   - `read()`  ‚Üí Reads from a file.

3. **üîå Device Management**
   - `close()` ‚Üí Closes a file or device descriptor.

4. **‚ÑπÔ∏è Information Maintenance**
   - `getpid()` ‚Üí Gets the current process ID.
   - `times()`  ‚Üí Returns CPU usage times.

5. **üì° Communication**
   - `pipe()`   ‚Üí Sets up one-way communication.
   - `msgsnd()` ‚Üí Sends a message via a queue.


### üîπ Question 1.5.3: fork() + exec() + wait() Case


### üß™ Sample C Code:

```c
int ret = fork();

if (ret == 0) {
    printf("Hello1\n");
    exec("some_executable");
    printf("Hello2\n");
}
else if (ret > 0) {
    wait();
    printf("Hello3\n");
}
else {
    printf("Hello4\n");
}
```

### üìò Explanation of Output Possibilities


üîÑ Program Flow Overview:
-------------------------
- The program begins by calling `fork()` to create a child process.
- If `fork()` returns `0`, it means we are in the **child process**:
  - It prints **"Hello1"**
  - Then attempts to run a new program using `exec()`
- If `fork()` returns a **positive number**, we are in the **parent process**:
  - The parent waits for the child to finish
  - Then prints **"Hello3"**
- If `fork()` returns **-1**, it means process creation failed, and:
  - The program prints **"Hello4"**

---

üéØ Possible Output Scenarios:
-------------------------

### üìò Detailed Output Scenarios for Fork + Exec + Wait


üü¢ Scenario 1: fork() Succeeds and exec() Succeeds
--------------------------------------------------

Output:

```C
Hello1
Hello3
```
Explanation:
-------------
- The child process successfully prints "Hello1".
- It then calls `exec()`, which replaces the current child process with a new program.
- Since the child‚Äôs memory is replaced, it never reaches the line that prints "Hello2".
- The parent process waits for the child to finish and then prints "Hello3".

üîµ Scenario 2: fork() Succeeds and exec() Fails
----------------------------------------------

Output:
```C
Hello1
Hello2
Hello3
```

Explanation:
-------------
- The child process prints "Hello1".
- It attempts to call `exec()`, but the system cannot find or execute the specified file.
- As a result, the child continues execution and prints "Hello2".
- Meanwhile, the parent process waits, and once the child completes, prints "Hello3".

üî¥ Scenario 3: fork() Fails
---------------------------

Output:
```C
Hello4
```

Explanation:
-------------
- The `fork()` call fails and returns -1.
- The program enters the `else` block where it prints "Hello4".
- Since no child process is created, the program does not proceed with further actions.
