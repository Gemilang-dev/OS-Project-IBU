# OS Shell Project

## Task 1.1: Shell Interface

### Objective:
The goal of **Task 1.1** is to create a basic shell interface that continuously prompts the user for input, executes commands, and returns to the prompt to ask for new input. The shell should display a prompt that indicates readiness to receive commands and execute them. The prompt initially shows in a **Basic format** (`prompt$`), and we later updated it to display in an **Advanced format** (`machinename@username:~$`).

### **Basic Prompt and Advanced Prompt**

- **Basic Prompt**: Displays only `prompt$` when waiting for user input.
- **Advanced Prompt**: Displays `machinename@username:~$`, where `machinename` is the name of the system and `username` is the active userâ€™s name.

### **Functionality**
- The shell is designed to display a prompt and accept commands from the user.
- Users can switch between the **Basic Prompt** (`prompt$`) and **Advanced Prompt** (`machinename@username:~$`) by typing the command **`switch`**.

---

## How to Run the Shell

### Step 1: Compile the Program

To compile the shell, navigate to the project directory **`FirstProject/`** and run the following command:

```bash
make
```
This will compile the program and create the binary executable ./bin/shell.

Step 2: Run the Shell
Once compiled, you can run the shell with the following command:

```bash
./bin/shell
```
This will start the shell with the Advanced Prompt format by default.

## Switching Between Basic and Advanced Prompts

### Changing from Basic to Advanced Prompt and Vice Versa

- **Default Format**: When the shell starts, it displays the prompt in **Advanced format** by default. The prompt will look like:
```bash
machinename@username:~$
```
- **Switching to Basic Format**: To switch from **Advanced Prompt** to **Basic Prompt**, type the command:
```bash
switch
```
- **Switching Back to Advanced Format**: If you are currently in the **Basic Prompt**, you can switch back to the **Advanced Prompt** by typing the command:
```bash
prompt$
```

## List of Commands that can be Executed

Here is a list of basic commands that can be executed in the shell after implementing **Task 1.1**:

1. **`ls`**  
   - Lists the files and directories in the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```

2. **`exit`**  
   - Exits the shell program and returns to the terminal.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     exit
     ```

3. **`pwd`**  
   - Displays the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pwd
     ```

4. **`cd`**  
   - Changes the current working directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/directory
     ```

5. **`echo`**  
   - Prints the provided string to the console.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     echo "Hello, World!"
     ```

6. **`switch`**  
   - Switches between **Basic Prompt** and **Advanced Prompt**.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     switch
     ```
