Result: Pointer (ptr) to an empty block of memory that can be used like an array or regular buffer.

### **üìå munmap**

Function: Frees (unmaps) memory allocated by mmap.

```
munmap(ptr, 4096);
```

Parameter Explanation:


| Parameter | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ptr       | The starting address of the memory to be freed (must be the same as the result of mmap). |
| 4096      | The size of the memory to be freed (must be the same as when allocated).                 |

 Notes :

* mmap is useful when you want to manage memory manually, for example creating a replacement for malloc.
* After finishing using memory, always use munmap to prevent memory leaks.

### üìå 1. VSZ and RSS recording using `ps` at each stage

The following command was used to check memory usage:

```
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p pid
```

Results observed from your output:


| Stage                       | VSZ (KB) | RSS (KB) |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Initial                     | 2552     | 1708     |
| After`mmap()`               | 2556     | 1708     |
| After writing to memory**** | 2688     | 1776     |

Base on the table we can draw conclution as below:

- Since the process acquires a new virtual memory zone after calling mmap(), the Virtual Set Size (VSZ) somewhat grows.
- Linux's lazy allocation (which means no physical memory is allocated until the page is requested) means that RSS (Resident Set Size) stays intact after mapping.
- Writing to memory causes a page fault, which in turn causes the system to allocate real physical memory, therefore RSS increases only after that.

In code section:

```
void print_memory_usage(const char *stage) {
char command[256];   
snprintf(command, sizeof(command),
"echo \"\\n[%s]\" && ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p %d", // HERE
stage, getpid());  
system(command);  
}
```

`ps` is used to monitor memory usage during three stages of the `mmap_demo` program. So we get this result:


| Stage                   | VSZ (KB) | RSS (KB) |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Initial                 | 2552     | 1688     |
| After mmap              | 2556     | 1688     |
| After writing to memory | 2556     | 1692     |

From the information about the experiment it can be seen that:

- VSZ has been increased by 4 KB simultaneously with calling mmap. This shows a new memory mapping was added to the process‚Äôs address space.
- The Physical memory usage (RSS) is however the same, which indicates the memory is not physically allocated yet.
- After writing to the allocated memory, there is an increase in RSS by 4 KB. This shows that Linux indeed does ‚Äúlazy allocation‚Äù, providing actual physical pages only when they are accessed.
- Increase in RSS indicates a ‚Äúpage fault‚Äù that happened causing the OS to allocate a real physical page.
- Such behavior is observant in Linux anonymous memory mapping and shows further deferment to allocation until needed. Linux's free allocation techniques showcase inefficient memory management.

### üìå 2. /proc/pid/maps observation

#### a. After `mmap()` (before `memset()`)

The results of the many results from `/proc/<PID>/maps` These are the results that we can process :

```
7f70be6ae000-7f70be6b1000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
```

**Interpretation:**

* This is the memory region created by `mmap()`.
* Permissions: `rw-p` ‚Üí Read/Write and Private.
* No file mapping ‚Üí It‚Äôs anonymous memory.
* Size: 4 KB (from `...ae000` to `...b1000`).

From these data it can be concluded that :

> Although the memory region is visible in the maps file, it has not yet used any physical memory because no access/write has occurred

#### b. After writing to memorysss

Following the writing of the memory map to it by memset(), we re-examined it using /proc//maps.   The mmap()-generated anonymous memory area's virtual address range and permissions remained unchanged and visible.

For example:

```
7f70be6ae000-7f70be6b1000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
```

Thus, it is confirmed that the identically mapped memory region remained operational.

While there was no outward change to the address range, we did see that the process data's RSS (Resident Set Size) increased from 1708 KB to 1776 KB.   This indicates that the memory was accessed (written to) after the kernel has already allocated physical memory to support that location.

Because Linux uses a lazy allocation method, which typically results in a page fault upon first access, this conduct is consistent with that method.   Operating systems increase RSS when they map a physical frame to satisfy an access.

### Interpretation:

* In '/proc/<PID>/maps', you can see that the anonymous memory was still allocated after writing.
* *It has been confirmed by the increase in RSS that physical memory was allocated only after access occurred.  Physical memory was allocated immediately upon access, as confirmed by the increase in RSS.
* Lazy memory allocation and the triggering of a page fault on first write are compatible with this.  Lazy memory allocation and the triggering of a page fault on first write are compatible with this.

## Task 2.4 ‚Äì Explain Observations

This section summaries and elucidates the memory use behaviour of the mmap\_demo program using the `/proc//maps` file, the results of ps, and our understanding of Linux memory management algorithms.

### a. Memory Usage Observations

The memory usage at each stage of the program execution is as follows :


| Stage                    | VSZ (KB) | RSS (KB) | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial**              | 2552     | 1708     | Before any memory mapping                        |
| **After`mmap()`**        | 2556     | 1708     | Anonymous page mapped, but not yet used          |
| **After writing memory** | 2688     | 1776     | Page accessed (written to), physical memory used |

* The Virtual Set Size (VSZ) increased slightly after mmap() due to the expansion of the program's virtual address space.
* Maps had no effect on Resident Set Size (RSS) because the RAM wasn't used yet.
* The jump in RSS after writing to memory was an indication that the page was now being supported by actual physical memory.

### b. Excerpts from `/proc/<PID>/maps`

We observed the following relevant memory segment after mapping and writing to the memory:

```
7f70be6ae000-7f70be6b1000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
```

Here we have an anonymous private mapping that was created with MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE.  Throughout the entirety of the show, the region stayed.

As soon as the first write operation was performed, the RSS data became backed by physical memory; the memory range stayed constant throughout the mapping and writing steps.

### c. Analysis & Explanation

These observations confirm key concepts of **Linux memory management**:

* **Lazy Allocation**: When a process uses `mmap()` to map memory, Linux does not immediately allocate physical pages. Instead, it reserves the address space in the virtual memory layout.
* **Page Faults**: Physical memory is only allocated when the process accesses the page (e.g., by writing to it). This triggers a **page fault**, which causes the kernel to allocate a page frame and map it to the corresponding virtual address.
* **Impact on RSS**: Since RSS measures the portion of memory that is physically resident, it only increases after the memory is accessed. This explains why VSZ increased slightly after mapping, but RSS did not rise until the write occurred.

### Conclusion

Through this experiment, we clearly demonstrated how **memory mappings behave differently before and after access**, and how tools like `ps` and `/proc/<PID>/maps` help visualize these changes. The results matched expectations and provided hands-on insight into **virtual vs physical memory**, **lazy allocation**, and **demand paging** in Linux.
